###sokoban-axioms:
A formulation of the Sokoban domain using axioms. There are two
encodings: one uses only classical (STRIPS) PDDL and axioms, the
other uses "Functional STRIPS" (i.e., object-valued fluents, a la
PDDL 3.1). More on this below.

###psr-middle-noce:
The PSR middle-sized problem set from IPC 2004, formulation with
axioms but without conditional effects.

##kominis-geffner:
Problems by Filippos Kominis and Hector Geffner, from their paper
"Beliefs in Multiagent Planning: From One Agent to Many" (ICAPS 2015).
These are cooperative multi-agent planning with partial observability
and nested beliefs, compiled into planning with axioms. They were
provided to us by Filippos Kominis.

- Conditional Effects

Sum(n) is a domain based on ”What is the Sum?” (van Ditmarsch,
van der Hoek, and Kooi 2007b), which in turn borrows
from the ”Sum and Product Riddle” (van Ditmarsch,
Ruan, and Verbrugge 2008) and the Muddy Children. There
are three agents a, b, and c, each one with a number on his
forehead between 1 and n. It is known that one of the numbers
must be the sum of the other two. In addition, each agent
can see the numbers on the other agent’s foreheads, and can
